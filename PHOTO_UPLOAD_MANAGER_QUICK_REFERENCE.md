**Problem**: File shows ⚠️ "No match"  
**Solution**: Check entry number in filename matches actual entry

**Problem**: Toast shows error message  
**Solution**: 
- Check internet connection
- Verify file is JPG or PNG
- Try individual upload instead

### Photo Too Large
**Problem**: File is 5MB+  
**Solution**: System auto-compresses to < 1MB (no action needed)
