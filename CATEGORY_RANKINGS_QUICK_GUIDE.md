# 🏆 CATEGORY COMBINATION RANKINGS - QUICK GUIDE

## WHAT CHANGED?

### BEFORE ❌
- All dancers competed against each other
- One overall winner
- Example: Entry #5 is 1st place overall

### AFTER ✅
- Dancers compete within their exact category combination
- Multiple 1st place winners (one per combination)
- Example: 
  - Entry #5 is 1st in "Tap Variety A - Junior Primary - Beginner"
  - Entry #12 is 1st in "Jazz (None) - Junior Advanced - Intermediate"

## CATEGORY COMBINATION

A combination consists of 4 factors:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. Category (e.g., Tap, Jazz, Ballet)  │
│  2. Variety Level (None, A, B, C, D, E) │
│  3. Age Division (Junior/Senior groups)  │
│  4. Ability Level (Begin/Inter/Advanced)│
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Examples of DIFFERENT Combinations:

| Combination 1 | Combination 2 | Difference |
|--------------|---------------|------------|
| Tap Variety A - Junior Primary - Beginner | Tap (None) - Junior Primary - Beginner | Variety Level |
| Jazz (None) - Junior Primary - Beginner | Jazz (None) - Junior Advanced - Beginner | Age Division |
| Hip Hop Variety E - Senior Youth - Intermediate | Hip Hop Variety E - Senior Youth - Advanced | Ability Level |

**Each different combination = Separate competition!**

## EXPORTS

### PDF Score Sheets

Each entry's PDF now shows:

```
🏆 1st Place in Category Combination
```

### Excel Export

Two rank columns:

| Column Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Overall Rank | Traditional rank (1st across all entries) |
| Category Combination Rank | Rank within specific combination |

---

## WHY THIS IS BETTER

### Fair Competition ✅
- Beginners don't compete against Advanced
- 3-7 year olds don't compete against 13-18 year olds
- Tap dancers don't compete against Jazz dancers

### More Winners 🏆
- Multiple 1st place awards
- Every combination has its own champion
- More recognition for participants

### Clear Categories 📊
- Easy to see who won in each group
- No confusion about "which category"
- Professional competition structure

---

## FAQ

### Q: Can I still see overall rankings?
**A:** Yes! Switch to "Custom Filter" tab. The overall rankings are still calculated and available.

### Q: How many 1st place winners will there be?
**A:** Depends on combinations. If you have:
- 7 categories
- 2 variety options per category (None + one variety)
- 4 age divisions
- 3 ability levels

Maximum possible: 7 × 2 × 4 × 3 = 168 groups

In practice, you'll have far fewer because not every combination will have entries.

### Q: Does this affect the Medal Program?
**A:** Currently, Medal Program still uses overall rankings for point awards. This may be updated in the future to use category combination rankings.

### Q: What if a dancer is the only one in their combination?
**A:** They'll be 1st place in that combination! They still earned it by participating.

### Q: Can I export just one combination?
**A:** Not yet, but this is a planned feature. Currently, exports include all entries with both overall and category combination ranks.

## TIPS

### For Competition Organizers:

1. **Review Combinations Before Competition**
   - Check how many entries per combination
   - Consider combining sparse combinations if needed

2. **Communicate to Parents**
   - Explain the new ranking system
   - Clarify that "1st Place" means "1st in their category combination"

3. **Use Appropriate View Mode**
   - "By Category Combination" for awards ceremonies
   - "Custom Filter" for specific analysis

### For Judges:

- No changes to scoring process
- Score entries normally
- Ranking calculations happen automatically

## VISUAL COMPARISON

### OLD SYSTEM ❌

```
Overall Rankings (ALL ENTRIES):
1st - Entry #15 (Jazz, Advanced, 95.0)
2nd - Entry #5 (Tap, Beginner, 92.5)
3rd - Entry #22 (Jazz, Advanced, 93.5)

Problem: Entry #5 (Beginner) competing against
         Entry #15 and #22 (Advanced)
```

### NEW SYSTEM ✅

```
Tap Variety A - Junior Primary - Beginner:
1st - Entry #5 (92.5) 🥇

Jazz Variety B - Junior Advanced - Advanced:
1st - Entry #15 (95.0) 🥇
2nd - Entry #22 (93.5) 🥈

Fair: Beginner competes with Beginners,
      Advanced competes with Advanced
```

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: "I don't see any groups"
**Solution:** Judging may not be complete. Wait for all judges to submit scores.

### Problem: "Too many small groups"
**Solution:** This is normal if you have diverse entries. Consider this means you have good category coverage!

### Problem: "I want the old view back"
**Solution:** Click "Custom Filter" tab. The original view is still there!

### Problem: "Export doesn't show category ranks"
**Solution:** Make sure you've re-exported after this update. Old exports won't have the new columns.
